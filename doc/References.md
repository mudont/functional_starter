## Example projects
These projects do almost everything we need. Should answer all HowTo questions:
- [Servant websockets + React client dec 2019](https://github.com/dnikolovv/haskell-tic-tac-toe)\
  Very nice looking Haskell code on the server side (Servant + Websockets + JWT)
- [Freer-simple + Servant](https://github.com/alasconnect/haskell-web-app-freer)
- [Examples of effect systems for same program](https://github.com/stepchowfun/effects)
- [Servant Realworld Conduit](https://gitlab.com/ibnuda/real-world-conduit) | [Write up](https://siskam.link/2018-07-02-thinkster-s-realworld---backend.html) || [Another Impl](https://gitlab.com/ibnuda/real-world-conduit)
- [Template for 3 layer cake. Servant. Generates Elm types and decoders](https://github.com/Holmusk/three-layer)
- [Purescript Realworld Conduit client](https://github.com/thomashoneyman/purescript-halogen-realworld)
- [Elm Realworld Conduit client](https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example)
- [Wai websocket server, CycleJS client for a multiplayer game](https://github.com/dschalk/functional-javascript)\
  Very imperative looking Haskell code on the server side in Main.hs
- [example Polysemy+Servant](https://github.com/EncodePanda/todo-rest)
- [Purescript with react/plotly](https://github.com/ntwilson/playground)
- [Selda/Servant app by Selda author, with React client](https://github.com/valderman/hootsman)
- [Servant+Elm+Password login](https://github.com/3kyro/servant-auth-elm.git)
- [TicTacToe](https://github.com/dnikolovv/haskell-tic-tac-toe.git) 
Great project for learning
  - just 749 lines of Haskell in the server . Worth understanding every line
  - 714 lines of React/Redux JS code in client
  - Servant
  - Websockets
  - Uses Data.Has to manage monad stack in one layer
  - good example of Structuing a medium sized project
  - coding patterns for pubsub in Haskell
- [Liberty Go Server](https://github.com/Maxfield-Chen/liberty-go-server.git)

  - All haskell frontnd and backend. 
  - Nix (this is very different from using Stack, and thus a deterrant)
  - Beam for Sqlite frontend
  - STM
  - PUbSub
  - Websockets
[Haskell Web apps](https://github.com/vacationlabs/haskell-webapps) Goal seems similar to mine. Maybe I can contribute
